## Final Write-Up

#### Short Abstract

#### Introduction
Data from the ACS NSQIP dataset from the years 2014-2016 was used for this analysis. This data contains over 150 demographic and health variables such as preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative outcomes for inpatient and outpatient patients undergoing major surgical procedures (1). From 2014-2016, the data contained records of 565 patients identified as having undergone endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), approximately 0.02% of the entire dataset (2). Other papers have used the NSQIP dataset to examine the relationship between a specific health condition and ESS outcomes. For example, the  "Effect of diabetes mellitus on postoperative endoscopic sinus surgery outcomes" used NSQIP data from 2005-2013 to analyze ESS outcomes for patients with diabetes mellitus (3).
