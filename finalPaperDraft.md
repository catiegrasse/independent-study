## Final Write-Up

#### Short Abstract

#### Introduction
Chronic Rhinosinusitis has been rising in the US population since 1991, with 15% of the US population being affected by the disease in 2009 (4). This paper seeks to examine the effect of preoperative health conditions on postoperative endoscopic sinus surgery in adult patients. Data from the ACS NSQIP dataset from the years 2014-2016 was used for this analysis. This data contains over 150 demographic and health variables such as preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative outcomes for inpatient and outpatient patients undergoing major surgical procedures (1). From 2014-2016, the data contained records of 565 patients identified as having undergone endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), approximately 0.02% of the entire dataset (2). Other studies have demonstrated the usefulness of the NSQIP dataset in examining the relationship between a specific health condition and ESS outcomes. A study used NSQIP data from 2005-2013 to analyze ESS outcomes for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), finding that patients with DM are at a greater risk for for postoperative medical complications following ESS (3). Rather than focus on a specific comorbidity, this study took a broad approach by looking at multiple comorbidities that were included as variables in the dataset and analyzing statistically significant results.

#### Experimental Set-Up 

#### Experimental Results

#### Conclusion
Since this analysis used data only from the years 2014-2016 in the NSQIP database, there were certain outcomes and comorbidities with 10 or less patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting, or in total, which did not allow for robust analysis. Further research could be done using a larger sample of the NSQIP dataset to both validate the results shown in this paper as well as analyze less common comorbidities and postoperative complications.
