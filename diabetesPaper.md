## Analysis
#### Source: "Effect of diabetes mellitus on postoperative endoscopic sinus surgery outcomes"  
This paper analyzed the NSQIP database from the years 2005 - 2013 (our data: 2014 - 2016)  
From this group in the database, found 644 patients identified as having undergone ESS  (our data: 565 patients (approx .02% of total database)))
- Paper: 85/644 (13.2%) had DM vs Our data: 69/565 (12.2%) had DM 
- Paper: DM patients were significantly older than non-DM patients vs Our data: average age of patient with DM = 54 vs average age of patient without DM = 44

| Unplanned Readmission | 3.83% | 5.79% | 0.440 | 0.252 |

- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and hypertension were the only statistically significant comorbidities according to the paper
- In my analysis, only hypertension appeared to be statistically significant (p < 0.05)
